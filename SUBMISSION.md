# Flask-based Full-Stack Tasks API

## Getting started

### Installating Dependancies
Developers using this project must have [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed.

This project uses a virtual environment (venv) to isolate dependancies and prevent version conflicts (optional, but recommended). If you're using a python virtual environment as well, open your terminal and run:

```
source backend/{env-name}/bin/activate
``` 
(assuming `env-name` is the name of your virtual environment)

Once your virtual environment is ready, run:

```
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

## Running the server

Before proceeding ensure that your virtual environment has been activated. Not doing so can lead to messy module import errors. To run the app, open yor terminal and run:

```
python backend/app.py
```

## API Reference

### Overview
* Base URL: The backend is assumed to be hosted at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
